A nodejs / Socket.io Chat Application demo to showcase client // server interactions. 
This is a component to the stand-alone Video App. 


# Prerequisites

Ruby and Nodejs and needed to begin this project.

# Requirements

Use Node and socket.io to create an interactive chat application. Design an engaging skin
for the application using HTML / CSS; add transitions / interesting micro transactions using
a combination of JS and CSS (or you can use something like Greensock).
Expand on the default functionality to include a notification message when a user joins or
leaves the chat; use colour to differentiate between user messages; choose one other
enhancement to implement ( refer to the documentation @ https://socket.io/ ). 

# Libraries / Tutorials
